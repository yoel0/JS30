			<h1>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..</h1>
			<h3>THE PHANTOM MENACE</h3>
			<p>
				Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes
				to outlying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter
				with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has
				stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo. While the Congress of
				the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the
				Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the
				guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict.

			<h3>ATTACK OF THE CLONES</h3>
			<p>
				There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems
				have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This separatist
				movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made
				it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace
				and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is
				returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on the critical issue of
				creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi.

			<h3>REVENGE OF THE SITH</h3>
			<p>
				War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord,
				Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere. In a
				stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept
				into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of
				the Galactic Senate. As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the
				besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a
				desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor.

			<h3>A NEW HOPE</h3>
			<p>
				It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden
				base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

				During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
				Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with
				enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's
				sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian
				of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the
				galaxy.
			</p>
			<h3>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK</h3>
			<p>
				It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been
				destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their
				hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. Evading the dreaded
				Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker
				has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. The
				evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has
				dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space.
