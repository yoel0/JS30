			<h3>A Dev's take on Nipsey's - "Grinding all my life"</h3>
			<p>
				All my life, been grindin' all my life<br />
				Sacrificed, git push paid the price<br />
				Want a slice? Got to roll the Node<br />
				That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life<br />
				Look, all my life, been grindin' all my life (yeah)<br />
				Sacrificed, git push paid the price (whoa)<br />
				Want a slice? Got to roll the Node<br />
				That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
			</p>
			<p>
				We married to this code, that's who we made our spouse<br />
				One thing that's for sure, not a stranger to these DOCS<br />
				Got a safe that's full of BUGS and a shoulder full of stripes<br />
				I don't know Dev's like ourselves<br />
				We stay studying, meanin' We designed ourselves<br />
				Open Source, you can pull request our projects yourself<br />
				Absolutely, We like the apps We Built<br />
				We're from, 127.0.0.1, Standin' so tall<br />
				Legendary Devs, like Linus, like Bjarne<br />
				'404, Dev life on wheels
